/*
 Dart is a true object-oriented language, so even functions are objects and have a type, Function. 
 This means that functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions
 
 Every app must have a top-level main() function, which serves as the entrypoint to the app. 
 The main() function returns void and has an optional List<String> parameter for arguments..

void main() {
  print("Main Execution Started...");
